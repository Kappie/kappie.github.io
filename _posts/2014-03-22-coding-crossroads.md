Ever heard of [Robert Johnson's myth](http://crossroads.stormloader.com/)? He made a deal with the devil for legendary guitar skills. 

This is a guide to selling your soul for programming prowess.

I will describe a period in which I made a lot of progress by making good use of learning materials.

### Exercism

I had done a little Ruby. I could do fairly complicated tasks. It wasn't legible code, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?

Then I found [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) (note their logo --- it's a devil.) I took off.

This is the deal: you get a test suite and a problem description. You get it to work. But the real challenge is to write beautiful code. After you're done, you submit your code and receive feedback from others.

I didn't wait for feedback. Instead, I skimmed through others' solutions, looking for cleaner solutions than my own. I found a couple of users, most notably [henrik](http://exercism.io/henrik), who were professionals, but still took the time to explain the considerations that they made while writing their code.

Nothing new, of course. Jazz musicians transcribe solos of their favorite artists. Chess players play through games of the masters.

I always aim for this type of learning: stretching the boundaries of your knowledge while getting feedback from someone far better than you. Exercism made it possible for aspiring programmers.
