I'm looking for a PhD or a teaching job. My activities in the past couple of years:

- I just finished my [MSc thesis](./KapteijnsGeert_ThesisFinal.pdf) in
theoretical physics at the University of Amsterdam, for which I received
an 8.5.
- I taught undergrad problem classes at the University of Amsterdam.
- I taught my own programming
  courses to students and high schoolers (more information:
  [Rubyprog](http://rubyprog.nl) -- I might start using them again in the
  future).
- I wrote a piece on how the journal sciences should proceed if they
  want open access: [Scientists: support a self-archiving mandate to free the
  peer-reviewed journal
  literature](KapteijnsGeert_ScientistsSupportASelf-ArchivingMandate.pdf). It
  was written as a response to the horrible official policy in The Netherlands.
- Before all that I got a MSc software engineering at the University
  of Amsterdam

My CV is [here](KapteijnsGeert_CV.pdf).
