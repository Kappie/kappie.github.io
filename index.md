Hi, I'm Geert, a PhD student working at the University of Amsterdam under the supervision of [Edan Lerner](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/e.lerner/).

My research focuses on amorphous solids and the glass transition.
In particular, I study the statistical and mechanical properties of low-lying vibrational modes of model computer glasses,
with the goal of understanding the role these excitations play in determining the dynamics and thermodynamics of glassy materials.

Visualizations of soft quasilocalized vibrational modes in (a) 2D, (b) 3D, and (c) a 3D projection of a 4D mode.
(d) Symbols represent the spatial decay of the squared magnitude of the modes shown in panels (a)–(c), as a function of the distance 
\(r\) away from the modes’ respective cores. <em>From:

Stress-strain curves for computer glasses made with \(k_{\lambda} = 10^4\)
, \(3 \times 10^3\)
, \(10^3\) and \(10^1\)
, from (a) to (d). Stresses are
rescaled by their respective average steady-state values. The large insets show representative snapshots of the deformed solids; the color
coding represents the magnitude of total nonaffine displacements \(\delta x\) measured between \(\gamma = 0\) and \( \gamma = 0.13 \),
rescaled by the length \( \rho^{−1/3} \).
The small inset illustrates the geometry of the applied shear deformation.
