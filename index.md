Hi, I'm Geert, a PhD student working at the University of Amsterdam under the supervision of [Edan Lerner](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/e.lerner/).

My research focuses on amorphous solids and the glass transition.
In particular, I study the statistical and mechanical properties of low-lying vibrational modes of model computer glasses,
with the goal of understanding the role these excitations play in determining the dynamics and thermodynamics of glassy materials.
